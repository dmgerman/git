============

NAME
----
git-author - Extract accurate authorship information for lines of code

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git author' [-c] [-f] [-L n,m] [-n] [--one-line] [-W] [--] <file>


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Extract complete development history of a line of code.

Provide two main working modes:
1. Identify all authors/commits that changed a line of code.
2. Calculate a weight for each author based on the contribution to a line of
code

Please see our paper in ICSM 2013 for more technical details

EXAMPLES
--------------
Ex 1: Show complete development history for a line
$ git author -c -L 2235,2235 fs/ext4/mballoc.c 
       CURRENT LINE 2235:       meta_group_info[i] = kmem_cache_zalloc(cachep, GFP_KERNEL);             
85556c9 Wei Yongjun     :       meta_group_info[i] = kmem_cache_zalloc(cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
fb1813f Curt Wohlgemuth :       meta_group_info[i] = kmem_cache_alloc(cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
5f21b0e Frederic Bohe   :       meta_group_info[i] = kzalloc(len, GFP_KERNEL);
c9de560 Alex Tomas      :               meta_group_info[j] = kzalloc(len, GFP_KERNEL);

In this example, git-author shows the complete development history of a line code. 
we can see "Wei Yongjun" is the last programmer who changed the
line and "Wei Yongjun" is shown to be blamed for this line by git-blame. 
However, "Wei Yongjun" only changed the line to call a different function (from "kmem_cache_alloc" to "kmem_cache_zalloc").
"Wei yongjun" is not responsible for the other part of the line.
We can see "Curt Wohlgemuth" changed the line to call a different function (from "kzalloc" to "kmem_cache_alloc") and to 
use a different parameter (from "len" to "cachep") and "Frederic Bohe" changed the line to use a different array index
(from "i" to "j").


EX 2: Calculate contribution weights for specified line range
$ git author -W -L 2233,2238 --one-line fs/ext4/mballoc.c 

2233: (c9de560,Alex Tomas,37/43=86.05%) (5f21b0e,Frederic Bohe,6/43=13.95%)
2234: (c9de560,Alex Tomas,0/0=NA)
2235: (c9de560,Alex Tomas,43/60=71.67%) (5f21b0e,Frederic Bohe,1/60=1.67%) (fb1813f,Curt Wohlgemuth,15/60=25.00%) (85556c9,Wei Yongjun,1/60=1.67%)
2236: (c9de560,Alex Tomas,11/34=32.35%) (5f21b0e,Frederic Bohe,1/34=2.94%)
2237: (c9de560,Alex Tomas,37/53=69.81%) (9d8b9ec,Theodore Ts'o,16/53=30.19%)
2238: (5f21b0e,Frederic Bohe,23/23=100.00%)

In this example, each author is assigned a weight in terms of the contribution
it made to a line of code


OPTIONS
-------

-c::
	Show the corresponding line of code in each commit

-f::
	Show original filename

-L <start>,<end>::
	Work with only the given line range.  

-n::
	Show original line number

--one-line:
	All information for a line of code is in one line

-W::
	Calculate contribution weight for each author
